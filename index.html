        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
            I was cold and afraid...
            I looked around for items to light a fire...
            I was able to find some matches but they were too damp...
            Fumbling around in the dark I found a light switch...
            Flipping the switch caused all the electronics to turn on at once...
            An old television splashes on in the corner...
